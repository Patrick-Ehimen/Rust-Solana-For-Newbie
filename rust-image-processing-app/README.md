## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Rust and Cargo installed on your machine. You can install them from [rust-lang.org](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

### Building the Application

To build the application, navigate to the project directory and run:

```
cargo build
```

### Running the Application

To run the application, use the following command:

```
cargo run -- <image_path> <operation> [options]
```

Replace `<image_path>` with the path to the image file you want to process, `<operation>` with the desired operation (e.g., `resize` or `filter`), and `[options]` with any additional parameters required for the operation.

### Example Usage

1. **Resizing an Image:**

```
cargo run -- path/to/image.jpg resize --width 800 --height 600
```

2. **Applying a Filter:**

```
cargo run -- path/to/image.jpg filter --type grayscale
```
